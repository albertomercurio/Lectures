## Introduction

[QuantumToolbox.jl](https://github.com/qutip/QuantumToolbox.jl) was born during my Ph.D., driven by the need for a high-performance framework for quantum simulations. At the time, I was already using [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) (Quantum Toolbox in Python).

```

However, I was looking for a more efficient solution. I initially explored [QuantumOptics.jl](https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOptics.jl), but its syntax differed significantly from QuTiP’s, which made the transition challenging. Motivated by the desire for both performance and familiarity, as well as a deep curiosity to learn Julia, I decided to develop my own package.

## A Demo Code: the Schrödinger Equation

Let's consider a quantum harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian ($\hbar = 1$)

$$
\hat{H} = \omega_0 \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} \, ,
$$

and start from the state

$$
\left| \psi(0) \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \left| 2 \right\rangle + \left| 3 \right\rangle \right) \, .
$$

We now want to solve the Schrödinger equation

$$
i \frac{d}{dt} \left| \psi(t) \right\rangle = \hat{H} \left| \psi(t) \right\rangle \, .
$$

This can easily be done with QuTiP using the `sesolve` function. We also want to compute the expectation value of the position operator

$$
\left\langle \hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger \right\rangle (t) = \left\langle \psi(t) \right| \hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger \left| \psi(t) \right\rangle \, .
$$

An analytical solution is known, 

$$
\vert \psi (t) \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i 2 \omega_0 t} \vert 2 \rangle + e^{-i 3 \omega_0 t} \vert 3 \rangle \right) \, ,
$$

and so

$$
\langle \hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger \rangle (t) = \sqrt{3} \cos (\omega_0 t) \, ,
$$

and we can compare the numerical results with it.

### The QuTiP case

```python
import numpy as np
from qutip import *

N = 10 # cutoff for Fock states
a = destroy(N)
H = a.dag() * a

psi0 = (fock(N, 2) + fock(N, 3)).unit()
tlist = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
e_ops = [a + a.dag()]

result = sesolve(H, psi0, tlist, e_ops=e_ops)
```

### QuantumToolbox.jl: Almost the same syntax


```{julia}
using QuantumToolbox

N = 10
a = destroy(N)
H = a' * a

psi0 = (fock(N, 2) + fock(N, 3)) |> normalize
tlist = range(0, 10, 100)
e_ops = [a + a']

result = sesolve(H, psi0, tlist, e_ops=e_ops)
```

And we can plot the results using [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) for example


```{julia}
using CairoMakie

fig = Figure(size=(700, 300), fontsize=15)
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="Time", ylabel=L"\langle \hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger \rangle")

lines!(ax, result.times, real.(result.expect[1,:]), linewidth=3, label="Numerical")
lines!(ax, result.times, sqrt(3) .* cos.(result.times), linewidth=3, label="Analytical", linestyle=:dash)

xlims!(ax, result.times[1], result.times[end])

axislegend(ax)

fig
```

## The `QuantumObject` struct

If we take a look at the structure of the annihilation operator $\hat{a}$, we can see that it is a [`QuantumObject`](https://qutip.org/QuantumToolbox.jl/stable/resources/api#QuantumToolbox.QuantumObject) Julia constructor.

```{julia}
typeof(a)
```

```{julia}
a
```

A `QuantumObject` struct is defined as follows

```{julia}
#| eval: false

struct QuantumObject{MT<:AbstractArray,ObjType<:QuantumObjectType,N} <: AbstractQuantumObject{MT,ObjType,N}
    data::MT
    type::ObjType
    dims::SVector{N,Int}
end
```

The `data` field contains the actual data of the quantum object, in this case it is a sparse matrix. This follows from the definition of the matrix elements of the annihilation operator

$$
\langle n \vert \hat{a} \vert m \rangle = \sqrt{m} \ \delta_{n, m-1} \, ,
$$

where we defined $N$ as the cutoff for the Fock states. The `type` field gives the type of the quantum object

- `Ket` for ket states
- `Bra` for bra states
- `Operator` for operators
- `SuperOperator` for superoperators (e.g., Liouvillian)
- `OperatorKet` for vectorized representation of operators, acting as a ket state
- `OperatorBra` for vectorized representation of operators, acting as a bra state

Finally, the `dims` field contains the list of dimensions of the Hilbert spaces. Its length is equal to the number of subsystems, and each element is the dimension of the corresponding subsystem.

## Large Hilbert Spaces: The Need for GPU Acceleration

The example above was quite simple, where an analytical solution was known. However, in many cases, the system is more complex and even the numerical solution can be challenging. For instance, the Hilbert space dimension can be very large when considering many subsystems. Let's make a practical example by considering a 2-dimensional transverse field Ising model with 3x2 spins. The Hamiltonian is given by

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{J_z}{2} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{\sigma}_i^z \hat{\sigma}_j^z + h_x \sum_i \hat{\sigma}_i^x \, ,
$$

and, since we are including losses, the time evolution of the density matrix is governed by the Lindblad master equation

$$
\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho} = \mathcal{L}[\hat{\rho}] = -i[\hat{H}, \hat{\rho}] + \sum_k \left( \hat{L}_k \hat{\rho} \hat{L}_k^\dagger - \frac{1}{2} \{\hat{L}_k^\dagger \hat{L}_k, \hat{\rho}\} \right) \, ,
$$

with the dissipators

$$
\hat{L}_k = \sqrt{\gamma} \hat{\sigma}_k^- \, ,
$$

and $\gamma$ the decay rate.

### The vectorized representation of the density matrix

The Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$ is a superoperator, meaning that it acts on operators. A convenient way to represent its action is by vectorizing the density matrix

$$
\hat{\rho} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho_{11} & \rho_{12} & \cdots & \rho_{1N} \\
\rho_{21} & \rho_{22} & \cdots & \rho_{2N} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\rho_{N1} & \rho_{N2} & \cdots & \rho_{NN}
\end{pmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho_{11} \\
\rho_{21} \\
\vdots \\
\rho_{N1} \\
\rho_{12} \\
\rho_{22} \\
\vdots \\
\rho_{N2} \\
\vdots \\
\rho_{1N} \\
\rho_{2N} \\
\vdots \\
\rho_{NN}
\end{pmatrix} \, .
$$
